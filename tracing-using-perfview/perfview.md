## Collect traces from the command line

To collect traces into a 500MB file (in circular mode) run the following command:

`perfview -AcceptEULA -ThreadTime -CircularMB:500 -Circular:1 -LogFile:perf.output -Merge:TRUE -Zip:TRUE -noView  collect`

A new console window will open with the following text:

<code>Pre V4.0 .NET Rundown enabled, Type 'D' to disable and speed up .NET Rundown.
Do NOT close this console window.   It will leave collection on!
Type S to stop collection, 'A' will abort.  (Also consider /MaxCollectSec:N)</code>

Type 'S' when you are done with tracing and wait (DO NOT CLOSE THE WINDOW) till you see `Press enter to close window`. Then copy the files: PerfViewData.etl.zip and perf.output to the machine when you will perform analysis.

If you are also interested in the network traces append the -NetMonCapture option. This will generate additional PerfViewData_netmon.cab file which you may open in the Message Analyzer.

Open Perfview trace in WPA: `perfview /wpr unzip test.etl.zip`

This should create two files (.etl and .etl.ngenpdb): `wpa test.etl`

## Live view of events

The **Listen** user command enables a live view dump of events in the PerfView log. Example commands:

```
PerfView.exe UserCommand Listen Microsoft-JScript:0x7:Verbose

# inspired by Konrad Kokosa
PerfView.exe UserCommand Listen Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime:0x1:Verbose:@EventIDsToEnable="1 2"
```

## Grouping call stacks

The table below contains grouping patterns for various analysis targets


Scenario |  Pattern | Remarks
-------- | -------- | -------
Group requests | `^Request ID->ALL Requests` | Useful when we want to group all requests to analyze, for example, CPU times
Group requests by URL | `Request ID * URL:{*}->$1` | Useful when we want to group requests by URL to analyze, for example, CPU times
Group threads | `^Thread (%)-> ALL Threads` | Useful when we don't want to split the call stacks by threads in the call tree
Group async calls | `{%}!{%}+<>c__DisplayClass*+<<{%}>b__*>d.MoveNext()->($1) $2 async $3` | Christophe Nasarre presented this grouping pattern


## Issues

### (0x800700B7): Cannot create a file when that file already exists

If you receive:

<code>[Kernel Log: C:\tools\PerfViewData.kernel.etl]
    Kernel keywords enabled: Default
    Aborting tracing for sessions 'NT Kernel Logger' and 'PerfViewSession'.
    Insuring .NET Allocation profiler not installed.
    Completed: Collecting data C:\tools\PerfViewData.etl   (Elapsed Time: 0,858 sec)
    Exception Occured: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x800700B7): Cannot create a file when that file already exists. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800700B7)
       at System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHRInternal(Int32 errorCode, IntPtr errorInfo)
       at Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.Session.TraceEventSession.EnableKernelProvider(Keywords flags, Keywords stackCapture)
       at PerfView.CommandProcessor.Start(CommandLineArgs parsedArgs)
       at PerfView.CommandProcessor.Collect(CommandLineArgs parsedArgs)

       at PerfView.StatusBar.c__DisplayClass8.b__6(Object param0)
    An exceptional condition occurred, see log for details.
</code>

make sure that no kernel log is running: `perfview listsessions`

and eventually kill it: `perfview abort`
